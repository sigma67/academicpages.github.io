abstract = {Information systems in organizations are regularly subject to cyber attacks targeting confidential data or threatening the availability of the infrastructure. In case of a successful attack it is crucial to maintain integrity of the evidence for later use in court. Existing solutions to preserve integrity of log records remain cost-intensive or hard to implement in practice. In this work we present a new infrastructure for log integrity preservation which does not depend upon trusted third parties or specialized hardware. The system uses a blockchain to store non-repudiable proofs of existence for all generated log records. An open-source prototype of the resulting log auditing service is developed and deployed, followed by a security and performance evaluation. The infrastructure represents a novel software-based solution to the secure logging problem, which unlike existing approaches does not rely on specialized hardware, trusted third parties or modifications to the logging source.},

abstract = {Permissioned distributed ledgers have recently captured the attention of organizations looking to improve efficiency, transparency and auditability in value network operations. Often the technology is regarded as trustless or trust-free, resulting in a false sense of security. In this work, we review the various trust factors present in distributed ledger systems. We analyze the different groups of trust actors and their trust relationships to the software layers and inherent components of distributed ledgers. Based on these analyses, we investigate how insiders may conduct attacks based on trust in distributed ledger components. To verify practical feasiblity of these attack vectors, we conduct a technical study with four popular permissioned distributed ledger frameworks: Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Ethereum and R3 Corda. Finally, we highlight options for mitigation of these threats.},
